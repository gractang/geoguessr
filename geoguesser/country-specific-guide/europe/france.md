# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France

## Quick Identifiers

I won't lie, for me the most distinguishing thing in France is the language. If you read it out loud and it sounds like a terrible American bastardization of French, that's probably what it is.

### Bollards

France has _very_ unique bollards for Europe. They are round with a pointy tip, unlike most European bollards which are more flat. Note that Scotland will sometimes have bollards that look similar to the red and white variety, but Scottish bollards are wider.

</div>

### Utility Poles

Note that Spain can have similar utility poles to the "ladder pole" below, but they are typically whiter in color. Also, some former French colonies (for instance, Senegal) can have very similar poles. Hopefully, you are not in danger of confusing France and Senegal.

Similar poles to the concrete "holey pole" shown below can be found in Romania, Hungary, and Poland, but these countries' poles usually have fewer holes than the French poles. Turkey can also have holes in their metal utility poles.

### Street Signs

Certain words such as "rue" (street) and "sauf" (except) are often seen on signs and are distinctly french. French signs also typically have a border going around the edge, like so:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/French_Signs.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>These signs are incredibly French. The yellow rectangle with the road number in it is unique to France.</p></figcaption></figure>

### Crossing Sign

### Roads

### Architecture

### Cars & Plates

The following car brands are quite popular in France.

## For the Nerds

Probably don't need this to identify France, but hey, if you're an ultra-tryhard...

### Phone Codes

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/French_Phone_Second.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Secondary phone codes. For instance, a number might go: 04 72 (Lyon)</p></figcaption></figure>

### Town Names

Suffixes can be a good indicator of region. In addition to those mentioned below, French towns ending in â€˜-heimâ€™ are likely to be in the east of France, closer to Germany. French towns ending in â€˜-azâ€™ are likely to be found in the French alps, typically around Annecy.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/France_Town_Endings.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>â€˜Commence parâ€™ means â€˜starts withâ€™, â€˜Fini endâ€™ means â€˜ends withâ€™ and â€˜Contientâ€™ means â€˜containsâ€™. (Source: Clement Bouchere).</p></figcaption></figure>

Many towns in France are situated on a river and this is reflected in their name. In these instances, the town will be called â€˜name s/ riverâ€™ or â€˜name sur riverâ€™.
