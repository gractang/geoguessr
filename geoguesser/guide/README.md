# ðŸ—º Guide

## Level of Experience

Go to the appropriate section/page of the guide:

{% content-ref url="newbie.md" %}
[newbie.md](newbie.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="medium-rare/camera-generations.md" %}
[camera-generations.md](medium-rare/camera-generations.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="need-to-touch-grass/" %}
[need-to-touch-grass](need-to-touch-grass/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Note that I ripped a lot of this from [this guide](https://somerandomstuff1.wordpress.com/2019/02/08/geoguessr-the-top-tips-tricks-and-techniques/#how-to-identify-every-country-south-america), which is fantastic if a bit long-winded. If you want a good read though, the author manages to turn learning about stupid country facts into a good time.
